# hello-ato
A TTS-flavored [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) template for an ATO-ready system

## Why this project

This template supports scaffolding and maintaining a federal system, configured to the local tastes of TTS, ready for ATO from day one. It accomplishes this by composing [other `GSA-TTS/hello-*` templates](https://github.com/orgs/GSA-TTS/repositories?type=all&q=hello-) for managing various attributes of the system.

## Features

### Implemented

* Manages multiple ([Astro](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/hello-terraform-cloudgov)) applications within the boundary
* Deploys to [cloud.gov using Terraform](https://github.com/GSA-TTS/hello-terraform-cloudgov)
  * Deploy in personal sandboxes or to fully-managed spaces

### Planned (_help wanted!_ ðŸ˜˜ )

* Workflows for CI/CD
  * GitHub Actions 
  * GitLab CI 
* Moar application frameworks
  * SpiffWorkflow
  * Supabase
* Proxies egress traffic
* Drains logs to off-site ELPs
  * ELK (ingested from S3 bucket)
  * New Relic
* Generates compliance docs
  * Scaffolds OSCAL 
  * Auto-generates Mermaid diagrams
* Captures auditing artifacts (using auditree)
* Moar application frameworks
  * workflow (via SpiffWorkflow)
  * db-as-backend (via Supabase)
  * Drupal
  * Django
  * Rails

## Requirements
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (for running Copier)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Usage

### Creating an application
1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (if you haven't already)
2. Generate a new project...\
  ...from your local clone of the repository:
   ```sh
   uvx copier copy --trust ./hello-astro <destination-folder>
   ```
   ...or directly from the repository on GitHub:
   ```sh
   uvx copier copy --trust gh:GSA-TTS/hello-astro <destination-folder>
   ```
3. Answer the prompts:
   - Select which Astro template to use (`astro-plain` or `pages-site-gantry`).

### Updating the application later

If you'd like to...

- change your answers or 
- incorporate improvements made after you copied this template

...you can run the Copier `update` command: 

1. Make sure that your destination folder contains no uncommitted changes 
2. Update your destination folder from the most recently-tagged version of the template:
    ```
    uvx copier update --trust <destination-folder>
    ```
   If necessary, you can specify a specific tag or gitref:
    ```
    uvx copier update --trust -r GITREF <destination-folder>
    ```

To learn how updating works and what additional options are available, read [the Copier `update` documentation](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/updating/) .

Follow instructions in the README.md in the destination folder to work with the new site.

## Directory Structure
- `templates/astro-plain/`: Template for the minimal Astro starter
- `templates/astro-uswds`: Minimal template styles with USWDS and oriented toward 21st Century IDEA requirements
- `templates/pages-site-gantry/`: cg-pages' advanced starter with extra features, USWDS, etc.

## Developing

To ensure that copies reflect your local changes to the template, specify the HEAD revision on the command-line. For example...

When copying:
```
uvx copier copy --trust -r HEAD <template-folder> <destination-folder>
```

When recopying:

```
uvx copier recopy --trust -r HEAD <destination-folder>
```

When updating: 

```
uvx copier update --trust -r HEAD <destination-folder>
```
